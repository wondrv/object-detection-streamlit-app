   ```python
   # Old import (1.x)
   from detector import ObjectDetector
   
   # New import (2.x)
   from utils.detection import ObjectDetector
   ```

3. **Update Detection Results**:
   ```python
   # Old format (1.x)
   result = {"box": [x1, y1, x2, y2], "conf": 0.8, "class": "person"}
   
   # New format (2.x)
   result = {
       "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2], 
       "confidence": 0.8,
